## About me
Ciao! I'm a Ph.D. student at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/) (Lugano, Switzerland :switzerland:) in the [Graph Machine Learning Group](https://gmlg.ch/), which is a research team of the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence [IDSIA USI-SUPSI](https://www.idsia.ch/), under the supervision of Professor [Cesare Alippi](https://alippi.faculty.polimi.it/). 

I'm currently working at the intersection of Graph Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning.

## Background
I obtained the Bachelor's degree in [Physics](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/Physics) at the University of Bologna (Bologna, Italy :it:) in 2020, working on dynamical models for pedestrian dynamics in real-case scenarios. Subsequently, in 2022 I obtained the Master's degree in [Applied Physics](https://corsi.unibo.it/2cycle/Physics/course-structure-diagram/piano?code=9245&year=2020&manifest=en_2020_9245_000_B25_2020) from the same University, working on theoretical aspects of predictability and entropy for non-reversible Markov systems. 
In december 2022 I started my PhD at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/).
